Unity DOTS-Based Game System
Overview

This project is a high-performance Unity game system implemented using Unityâ€™s Data-Oriented Technology Stack (DOTS) principles. The system is designed to minimize heap allocations, efficiently manage memory, and ensure smooth gameplay, even when scaled to large numbers of entities. The primary gameplay features include enemy spawning, movement, shooting, and object pooling for both enemies and bullets.
Features
1. Object Pooling

    The game uses object pooling for enemies and bullets to minimize instantiations and garbage collection during runtime.
    Pooling ensures that objects are recycled and reused, reducing memory fragmentation and allocation spikes.

2. Efficient Health Management

    The Health component uses minimal state tracking and resets health efficiently when an entity is reused from the pool.
    Avoids unnecessary object destruction and recreation, improving runtime performance.

3. Physics Optimization

    Physics colliders are reset when objects are pooled to avoid lingering collisions and ensure accurate state transitions.
    Physics interactions are managed to minimize unnecessary collision checks.

4. Separation of Concerns

    Each gameplay feature (e.g., shooting, movement, spawning, health) is encapsulated in its own component, ensuring modularity and maintainability.
    Each system handles its responsibilities independently, reducing coupling and improving testability.

5. Memory Efficiency

    All game objects (enemies and bullets) are pre-instantiated and pooled. This ensures predictable memory usage and prevents runtime memory spikes caused by frequent instantiations and destructions.

Performance-Conscious Design
1. Object Pooling

    Object pooling significantly reduces runtime heap allocations by pre-allocating all necessary objects (e.g., enemies, bullets) at the start of the game.
    Eliminates the overhead of Instantiate and Destroy operations during gameplay.

2. Minimal Garbage Collection

    By reusing objects instead of destroying them, garbage collection events are minimized, ensuring smooth frame rates.
    All temporary allocations (e.g., vectors) are minimized in gameplay loops.

3. Physics Optimizations

    Colliders are disabled and reset during pooling to prevent unnecessary physics calculations.
    Physics interactions are limited to active objects only, reducing overhead.

4. Data-Oriented Design

    Game components are modular and operate independently, adhering to DOTS principles.
    Clear separation of concerns ensures that systems do not interfere with each other.

5. Efficient Algorithms

    Loops and algorithms are optimized to reduce computational overhead. For instance:
        Enemy spawning uses a pre-allocated pool instead of dynamic instantiation.
        Bullet lifetime management avoids unnecessary checks.
